# RPA Challenge 2.0
Our mission is to enable all people to do the best work of their lives‚Äîthe first act in achieving that mission is to help companies automate tedious but critical business processes. This RPA challenge should showcase your ability to build a bot for purposes of process automation.

## üü¢ The Challenge
Your challenge is to automate the process of extracting data from a news site.

You should push your code to a Github repo, and then use that repo to create a Robocloud process. The process should have a completed successful run before submission.

### The Source
You are free to choose from any general news website, feel free to select from one of the following examples.

https://www.nytimes.com/
https://apnews.com/
https://www.aljazeera.com/
https://www.reuters.com/
https://gothamist.com/
https://www.latimes.com/
https://nypost.com/
https://news.yahoo.com/
### Parameters
The process must process three parameters via the robocluod work item

search phrase

news category/section/topic

number of months for which you need to receive news (if applicable)

Example of how this should work: 0 or 1 - only the current month, 2 - current and previous month, 3 - current and two previous months, and so on

These may be defined within a configuration file, but we‚Äôd prefer they be provided via a Robocloud workitem

### The Process
The main steps:

Open the site by following the link

Enter a phrase in the search field

On the result page

If possible select a news category or section from the

Choose the latest (i.e., newest) news

Get the values: title, date, and description.

Store in an Excel file:

title

picture filename

count of search phrases in the title and description

True or False, depending on whether the title or description contains any amount of money

Possible formats: $11.1 | $111,111.11 | 11 dollars | 11 USD

Download the news picture and specify the file name in the Excel file

Follow steps 4-6 for all news that falls within the required time period

Specifically, we will be looking for the following in your submission:

Quality code Your code is clean, maintainable, and well-architected. The use of an object-oriented model is preferred.

We would advise you ensure your work is PEP8 compliant

Employ OOP

Resiliency Your architecture is fault-tolerant and can handle failures both at the application level and website level.

Such as using explicit waits even when using the robocorp wrapper browser for selenium

Best practices Your implementation follows best RPA practices.

Use proper logging or a suitable third party library

Use appropriate string formatting in your logs (note we use python 3.8+)

#### Please leverage pure Python

Please use pure Python (as demonstrated here) and pure Selenium (via rpaframework) without utilizing Robot Framework.

An example of using Selenium directly from rpaframework can be found here. You can use either the CustomSelenium or ExtendedSelenium approach.

#### GitHub

Create a repo on GitHub for your code.

When adding your robot to Robocloud add it via the GitHub app integration.

üì¢ While APIs and Web Requests are possible, the focus is on RPA skillsets, so please do not use APIs or Web Requests for this exercise.

#### ‚≠ê Bonus

Have fun with this challenge and express yourself. While the primary goal of this challenge is to assess your technical skills, we also love to see a sense of passion, creativity, and personality.

#### ü§ñ Robocorp Robot Name

Please name the organization your name or your company‚Äôs name, and the robot name your first and last name.
